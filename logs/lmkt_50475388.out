You are an experienced math teacher. You are given a dialogue between a student and teacher where the student is attempting to solve a math problem. You are also given this math problem. Your job is to predict if the student has a particular knowledge component at the current point in the dialogue. Please follow these instructions carefully when making your prediction:
- The student will need to possess this knowledge component in order to respond correctly to the teacher's most recent question.
- Use previous information in the dialogue to determine if the student has this knowledge component or not.
- Only respond with a single word, "True" or "False".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Teacher Turn 1: Hello Amelia 👋👋👋. Need some help with this question?!
Student Turn 1: yes
Teacher Turn 2: Of course 😁👍. For this one you need to think about place value columns... What place value column is the 3 in, any ideas? 💡

Student Turn 0: Hi
Teacher Turn 1: Hello Amina 😁👋. How can I help?!
Student Turn 1: I need help with this question
Teacher Turn 2: Let's try it by putting in 100 and seeing if we get 900 and then 800... 😁. Does that make sense?!

Knowledge Component:<|eot_id|> Apply properties of operations as strategies to multiply and divide. (Students need not use formal terms for these properties.) ^( )Examples: If 6 × 4 = 24 is known, then 4 × 6 = 24 is also known. (Commutative property of multiplication.) 3 × 5 × 2 can be found by 3 × 5 = 15, then 15 × 2 = 30, or by 5 × 2 = 10, then 3 × 10 = 30. (Associative property of multiplication.) Knowing that 8 × 5 = 40 and 8 × 2 = 16, one can find 8 × 7 as 8 × (5 + 2) = (8 × 5) + (8 × 2) = 40 + 16 = 56. (Distributive property.)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

<|eot_id|> Fluently multiply and divide within 100, using strategies such as the relationship between multiplication and division (e.g., knowing that 8 × 5 = 40, one knows 40 ÷ 5 = 8) or properties of operations. By the end of Grade 3, know from memory all products of two one-digit numbers.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

<|eot_id|> Apply the properties of operations to generate equivalent expressions. For example, apply the distributive property to the expression 3 (2 + x) to produce the equivalent expression 6 + 3x; apply the distributive property to the expression 24x + 18y to produce the equivalent expression 6 (4x + 3y); apply properties of operations to y + y + y to produce the equivalent expression 3y.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

<|eot_id|> Identify when two expressions are equivalent (i.e., when the two expressions name the same number regardless of which value is substituted into them). For example, the expressions y + y + y and 3y are equivalent because they name the same number regardless of which number y stands for.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
