torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 110.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 47.27 GiB of which 21.25 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 47.24 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 44.98 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 2.05 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
