How can I help?\nStudent Turn 1: Hi. I don't get this\nTeacher Turn 2: Ok, no worries, so you've got the equation: 3x + 2y=6. And the space in the table you need to fill in is when x=3. So, let's put x=3 into the equation. what will we then have?\nStudent Turn 2: 9+2y=6????\nTeacher Turn 3: Yes, great! So, now we only have one \"unknown\", so we can solve this to find the value of y. What shall we do first to solve this equation?\nStudent Turn 3: I don't know\nTeacher Turn 4: We need to try and get y on its own and we have to do the same to both sides so that it stays equal. So let's take away 9 from both sides of the equation. 9+2y-9 = 6-9. I've written out the equation , taking 9 from both sides. Can you simplify this?\nStudent Turn 4: 2-3\nTeacher Turn 5: Not quite....let's try again... So, on the left, we have 9+2y - 9=?\nStudent Turn 5: 1+-7y\nTeacher Turn 6: So, it's 9-9 which is 0 and so we're just left with 2y on the left.  Does this make sense?\nStudent Turn 6: O yes\nTeacher Turn 7: Great! And on the right we just have 6-9, which is?\nStudent Turn 7: -3\nTeacher Turn 8: Great! So, we started with 9+2y=6. we took away 9 from both sides and now we have... 2y= -3. So, now to get y on its own, we need to divide both sides by 2.

How can I help?\nStudent Turn 1: Hi Samantha, I understand the linear sequences but. I dont know how to get to pattern 15\nTeacher Turn 2: That's ok. Let's look for clues in the patterns we've been given. Pattern 1 is made up of 1 column of 4 and then 2 added on to the right. Can you see it that way?\nStudent Turn 2: Yes \ud83d\udc4d\nTeacher Turn 3: How many columns of 4 are in Pattern 4?\nStudent Turn 3: 4\nTeacher Turn 4: Great! So how many columsn of 4 do we think would be in Pattern 15?\nStudent Turn 4: would there be 15 columns and 2 dots on the right\nTeacher Turn 5: that's it! So we've found a possible pattern. Now look at Jake's method. Would this work?\nStudent Turn 5: yes because you would have 15 columns of 4 (15 X 4) and then the 2 dots at the end\nTeacher Turn 6: amazing :). so Jake is right. let's look at Lisa. Where do you think she might have got her -6 from?\nStudent Turn 6: I'm not sure\nTeacher Turn 7: If I filled in some circles to make each pattern into a rectangle how many circles would I need?\nStudent Turn 7: 6\nTeacher Turn 8: great! Is that the same in both patterns?\nStudent Turn 8: yes\nTeacher Turn 9: Now what's the height of each rectangle going to be? will it be the same or different each time?\nStudent Turn 9: the height would be the same because you have got a column of 4 dots each time\nTeacher Turn 10: fab! Now what about the base? What base would pattern 15 have?\nStudent Turn 10: would it be 17. dots\nTeacher Turn 11: Oo, can you tell me how you worked it out?\nStudent Turn 11: if you have 15 columns and you always have 2 dots at the end, you would do 15 + 2 which is 17\nTeacher Turn 12: Lovely! So what do you think about Lisa's method? What is she doing?\nStudent Turn 12: She is making the dots into a rectangle and then she takes away 6 dots to make it look like the actual pattern\nTeacher Turn 13: fantastic! So her method is correct as well. Are you happy with those?\nStudent Turn 13: yes, thank you\nTeacher Turn 14: I'll just give you some hints for the kinds of things that I looked for to help me spot it:. If there is a multiply (x) it often means we are counting columns or rows. If there is a plus (+) then it is likely we are just adding something on to our pattern each time (like the extra 2). If there is a subtract (-) try thinking about what the shape could have been before we subtracted those dots.

Shall we have a look at Lisa's statement first?\nStudent Turn 1: i am stil at maths we wer at on  email,\nTeacher Turn 2: No worries, so let's have a look at this question and see what we can make of it. Firstly, the number 340. In words, that is three hundred and forty. Because 3 is in the hundreds column, and 4 is in the tens column. The other number Lisa is looking at is 3040, which we can write in words as three thousand and forty. Because the three has moved into the thousands column :). Do you know which is more out of one thousand or one hundred? :)\nStudent Turn 2: i am sSorry i dont  get this\nTeacher Turn 3: That's ok :). I just wondered if maybe you'd learned that thousands were more than hundreds before, like you're able to deal with time :). If we're looking at whole, positive numbers, the more digits we have, the bigger it is. So in this case, 3040 is bigger than 340. But also, 1000000 is bigger than 10, for example :)\nStudent Turn 3: with time :) i no am is befor pm but i am not ok on this\nTeacher Turn 4: That's fine. So when we count the numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, the later on the number comes, the bigger it is. So 5 is greater than 1. That means if you have 5 apples you have more than 1. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e is bigger than \ud83c\udf4e.

To find the range you have to find the highest number take away the lowest. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\nTeacher Turn 3: Great, that is all good thinking.  So, y could be 10 you're correct. But there's already a number 10 so the range is already 10.  Could y have any other values?\nStudent Turn 3: Sorry I'm not too sure.\nTeacher Turn 4: No need to apologise, that's fine! If y was actually 3, what would the range of the data be?\nStudent Turn 4: 7! I think.\nTeacher Turn 5: Yes, great, so y could be 3, it could also be 10.  What if y was 2, what would the range be?\nStudent Turn 5: 12 maybe? I'm confused.\nTeacher Turn 6: I'm sorry that you're confused, it is a tricky question.  Normally, you would have had the correct answer, back when you said y=10.  The tricky bit of this question is that there is already a 10 in the data so the range is already 7 (10-3). So, you're completely correct that y could be equal to 10 and then the range is still 7, still 10-3. BUT, y does not have to be 10 for the range to be 7, because the range of the four numbers is already 7.\nStudent Turn 6: Yes okay!\nTeacher Turn 7: Does this make sense so far?  No problem if not.\nStudent Turn 7: It makes sense!!!!\nTeacher Turn 8: Fab! OK, so do you have any thoughts on what values y could or could not be?

I think.\nTeacher Turn 9: If y=17, then what would the range be?\nStudent Turn 9: Ohh 15!\nTeacher Turn 10: 17-3 = 14, so I think you've noticed that that doesn't work.\nStudent Turn 10: Whoops sorry typo .\nTeacher Turn 11: No problem!  So, we started with these numbers: 3,4,8,10, y.     There are a few values that y could take, it doesn't have to be bigger than 10, it's probably slightly confusing because it looks like the numbers are written smallest to biggest.\nStudent Turn 11: Yes!\nTeacher Turn 12: Tell me the range of these sets of numbers: a) 3,4,8,10,2. b) 3,4,8,10,4\nStudent Turn 12: 8! A) 8 B) 7\nTeacher Turn 13: Great! So can y=2?\nStudent Turn 13: No it can't.\nTeacher Turn 14: :-). Can y=4?\nStudent Turn 14: No! :D\nTeacher Turn 15: b) 3,4,8,10,4  This was the question where I put y=4, what did you say the range was?\nStudent Turn 15: 7!\nTeacher Turn 16: Yes!  And the range has to be 7, so can y=4?\nStudent Turn 16: YES!!\nTeacher Turn 17: Yes, great, now there are some other values that y can also take for the range to stay as 7.  Try y=5,6,7,8 Let me know what you think.\nStudent Turn 17: Yes they all can thank you! It doesn't matter as long as its not below 2 or above 10.\nTeacher Turn 18: Great!  Do you know how the symbols work, to pick the answer?\nStudent Turn 18: I have no idea. How the symbols work sorry.\nTeacher Turn 19: No problem! \u2264  means less than or equal to. \u2265 means greater than or equal to. So, y \u2264 3 would mean y is less than or equal to 3. y\u22653 means y is greater than or equal to 3. 3 \u2264 y \u2264 10 Have you any idea what this means?\nStudent Turn 19: I think y > with the line 3\nTeacher Turn 20: Yes, so, 3 \u2264 y \u2264 10  means that y is greater than or equal to 3.

If I start with 1cm and I multiply by 3 what would I get?\nStudent Turn 6: 3. 2\nTeacher Turn 7: We would get 3, but we wanted to end up with 2cm. So what do I need to multiply 1cm by to end up with 2cm?\nStudent Turn 7: 2\nTeacher Turn 8: Great! So that means our scale factor is 2. Basically the large shape is 2 times bigger than the small shape. Now what calculation did you do to work that out?\nStudent Turn 8: not sure\nTeacher Turn 9: What if the short side was 5cm and the longer side was 15cm. How would you find the scale factor?\nStudent Turn 9: 15 times 5\nTeacher Turn 10: Try it out. If we multiply the short side by 5 do we get 15? 5 x ? = 15\nStudent Turn 10: 3. scale factor is 3\nTeacher Turn 11: great! So the calculation you have done is the larger side, divided by the smaller side. 15 divided by 5. that gives us our scale factor. So if we go back to the question and look at the letters, how would we find our scale factor?\nStudent Turn 11: still not sure because it is letters\nTeacher Turn 12: Think about what we did. We divided the larger side by the smaller side. what letter represents the larger side?\nStudent Turn 12: b\nTeacher Turn 13: that's great! And the matching smaller side?\nStudent Turn 13: c\nTeacher Turn 14: oo not quite. It has to be the same side, but just on the smaller shape\nStudent Turn 14: a\nTeacher Turn 15: that's it! So how would we find our scale factor?\nStudent Turn 15: is it c divided by b and a\nTeacher Turn 16: Our scale factor would just be the b/a. Because we just need a pair of sides, and we divide the largest by the smallest. Now if we are finding a missing length on the larger shape we would have to multiply by our scale factor.

For example, if a = 2 and b = 3, then 4a + 6b = 4 x 2 + 3 x 6 = 8 + 18 = 26. But 10ab would be 10 x 2 x 3, which is 60.

In order to work out these values, we pick two points on the straight line that we know the coordinates of\nStudent Turn 2: Well we do have a longer line in the x axes\nTeacher Turn 3: Is this making sense so far? \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4d. So for example, we can pick the points... (0,3) and (2,-1) because we know those coordinates and those points lie on the line\nStudent Turn 3: Yes\nTeacher Turn 4: Awesome \ud83e\udd29\ud83d\udd25. So what is the change in the y values? If we've gone from 3 to -1?!\nStudent Turn 4: 4 less\nTeacher Turn 5: Excellent so we can say -4\nStudent Turn 5: Yes\nTeacher Turn 6: Then what have the x values changed by? Remember to always go the same way so we went from 3 to -1 so we go from 0 to 2...\nStudent Turn 6: Plus 2\nTeacher Turn 7: I would write this down... Gradient = change in y/ change in x. Perfect, well done Kareem \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\nStudent Turn 7: So is the answer negative 2\nTeacher Turn 8: So we have -4 / 2.

Let's have a look at the question. What do you undestand by linear?\nStudent Turn 2: Is linear a type of sequence where you do the same thing each time\nTeacher Turn 3: yes, that's it. so the difference between each term will increase or decrease at the same rate\nStudent Turn 3: It will decrease because 108 is bigger than 3 and 3 is after 108 in the sequence\nTeacher Turn 4: super... so how many numbers are between 108 and 3?\nStudent Turn 4: 2 \ud83d\ude0a\nTeacher Turn 5: so we have 3 differences to get from 108 to 3. from 108 to star, there are 2 differences. from star to 3, there is 1 difference\nStudent Turn 5: Do we have 1\ufe0f\u20e3, 2\ufe0f\u20e3, or 3\ufe0f\u20e3 differences.

An \"identity\" in maths is something that is ALWAYS true.\nStudent Turn 2: Ok\nTeacher Turn 3: And that sign that looks like an equals symbol but with 3 lines, is the sign for an identity. So, that is the symbol that is telling us that this is always true. So, let's look at Jack's identity first.\nStudent Turn 3: Ok\nTeacher Turn 4: 2x + 1 \u2261 3. So, if this is an identity, then this will be true for EVERY value of x.

Ok, so is this true for all value of x: 2x + 1 \u2261 3.     ?\nStudent Turn 6: Would x be 1. ?\nTeacher Turn 7: Well, yes, exactly for this to be true, x has to be 1. So, it is not true that 2x + 1 \u2261 3. Because this symbol \"\u2261\" is saying that it is true for all values of x, but as you've said, it's only true for x=1. Do you follow this?\nStudent Turn 7: I don't get it\nTeacher Turn 8: Ok, let me have another go....\nStudent Turn 8: What do mean by follow this\nTeacher Turn 9: Oh, sorry, I meant do you understand what I wrote?

So, now lets look at Emma's statement. Emma says that 2x + x \u2261 3x. So, because she's using the \u2261 symbol again, she's saying this is true for all values of x. What do you think about this?  Any idea whether this is an identity?\nStudent Turn 10: I think it might be a indentity\nTeacher Turn 11: Good thinking, why do you think this?\nStudent Turn 11: Because if I put a numer for th 1st x e.g. 4 it would be 8+x=3x. Then I could put e.g.4 for the 2nd xwhich would be 8+4=3x\nTeacher Turn 12: Yes, if you put x=4, 2x+x = 12. and 3x=12, so it works for x=4. Great! So, to be sure you would need to try lots of values OR we can prove it for sure another way. We can simplify the left hand side.\nStudent Turn 12: I don't get it\nTeacher Turn 13: How can you simplify 2x+x?  2x+x = ?x\nStudent Turn 13: How do we simplify and what do I simplify\nTeacher Turn 14: Simplify 2x+x, how many \"x\" is that altogether?\nStudent Turn 14: 2\nTeacher Turn 15: Yes, there's 2x and then another x is added on, how many \"x\" now?\nStudent Turn 15: 3\nTeacher Turn 16: Great!  So 2x+x=3x. And the identity is 2x + x \u2261 3x. 2x+x = 3x ALWAYS\nStudent Turn 16: Ok\nTeacher Turn 17: It's a bit like saying will 2 apples plus 1 apple always be 3 apples?\nStudent Turn 17: Yeah\nTeacher Turn 18: And I can change the apples to bananas or pears or anything and it will always be true.\nStudent Turn 18: yeah\nTeacher Turn 19: So therefore, it is always true that 2x+x = 3x, so that IS an identity.

Is 5/9 smaller than 1/2 or bigger than 1/2?\nStudent Turn 11: Less\nTeacher Turn 12: Let's have another think....what is half of 9?\nStudent Turn 12: 4.5\nTeacher Turn 13: Great, but we have 5 ninths.... Which is slightly more than 4.5...\nStudent Turn 13: 5.5\nTeacher Turn 14: Sorry, think I'm confusing you. ....let me try again... So, I'm trying to work out if 5/9 is smaller than 1/2, or bigger than a half... This will help me to know how to write these fractions in order of size.\nStudent Turn 14: It\u2019s bigger\nTeacher Turn 15: Yes, great, 5/9 is bigger than 1/2, because 5 is bigger than 4.5 (4.5 is half of 9). Ok, so if you write these 3 fractions in order from smallest to biggest, which is in the middle?\nStudent Turn 15: 5/9\nTeacher Turn 16: That's in the middle in the question, but you've just told me that 5/9 is bigger than 1/2.... So, the 3 fractions from smallest to biggest are:. 3/7, 1/2, 5/9.

Great!\nStudent Turn 6: yes i mean 28 haha. but how can i do 16-28 as a fraction\nTeacher Turn 7: 3 16/28 - 1 21/28. Yes, now I see the problem! :-). Ok....so we can't do that without another adjustment... any ideas?\nStudent Turn 7: not really\nTeacher Turn 8: No worries....let's make the numerator on the first fraction bigger. We're going to do this by knowing that 1 whole = 28/28. Does that statement make sense? What I mean is....do you agree that 1 whole=28/28?\nStudent Turn 8: yep\nTeacher Turn 9: Great!

If so, have a go at explaining it to me.\nStudent Turn 9: 2. oops. so you made it a whole and then re wrote it as 28/28 which is 1 whole and 16/28, and changewd the subtraction to an add\nTeacher Turn 10: Yes, that's right that I've changed 1 to 28/28 but I might have caused confusion with the add sign/. So, let's recap... You changed both fractions into equivalent fractions with denominators of 28. So, you now have the sum:. 3 16/28 - 1 21/28.

And I'm going to \"borrow\" 1 whole from the 3 so that I can make the numerator of the fraction bigger. Does that statement make sense?\nStudent Turn 11: so it would be 2?\nTeacher Turn 12: Yes, great!  The whole number becomes 2 \ud83d\udc4d.

Do you know what 'equivalent' means?\nStudent Turn 2: Yes it means the same\nTeacher Turn 3: Super! So we need to work our first whether 9/15 is the same as 12/20. Can you simplify 9/15 for me? As I think that will help us\nStudent Turn 3: I\u2019m not sure\nTeacher Turn 4: What factor do 9 and 15 have in common?\nStudent Turn 4: 1\nTeacher Turn 5: Great! Anything bigger than 1?\nStudent Turn 5: 3\nTeacher Turn 6: Lovely :). So what happens if we divide them both by 3?\nStudent Turn 6: 9 divide by 3 is 3 and q5 divided by 3 is 5\nTeacher Turn 7: Super! So we can say that 9/15 simplifies to 3/5. As long as we divide the numerator and denominator by the same amount it will still be equivalent. Now rather than seeing if 9/15 is the same as 12/20. we could instead see if our simplified version, 3/5 is the same as 12/20. What do you think?\nStudent Turn 7: Are we simplifying 12/20?\nTeacher Turn 8: We're just trying to work out if 3/5 is equivalent to 12/20. Is there anything you could multiply the top and bottom of 3/5 by to get 12/20?\nStudent Turn 8: 3x4 and 5x4\nTeacher Turn 9: amazing! So because we can multiply the numerator and denominator of 3/5 by the same amount to get to 12/20 we can say they are equivalent.

She thinks that 15/21 is equivalent to 9/15. Can you see what 15/21 simplifies to?\nStudent Turn 12: 5/3. no. 3/3\nTeacher Turn 13: Oo not quite. You were right to try to divide by 3.

Now is that the same as what we got when we simplified 9/15?\nStudent Turn 14: Yes\nTeacher Turn 15: Not quite. 9/15 simplified to 3/5. But this time we have 5/7.

Two things have happened to t when forming this equation. First, 3 was subtracted from t, and then the result was divided by 2. So to solve this equation we need to undo those operations, in the opposite order. What do you think the first step would be?\nStudent Turn 3: So like multiply 3\nTeacher Turn 4: Well we didn't divide by 3, so that's not the opposite of one of the steps that created the equation\nStudent Turn 4: I mean mutiply 3. Sorry\nTeacher Turn 5: The steps were to subtract 3 and divide by 2. So the opposite would be to multiply by 2 and then add 3\nStudent Turn 5: Ok\nTeacher Turn 6: So, what do we get if we multiply both sides of the equation by 2?\nStudent Turn 6: t-3=1/4\nTeacher Turn 7: Yes! And then the next step is to add 3 to both sides\nStudent Turn 7: T=29/4\nTeacher Turn 8: How did you 29/4? We had t - 3 = 1/4.

D is the Answer\nTeacher Turn 8: How did you get that?\nStudent Turn 8: Because 17 times 2 is 34 and 238 is not a multiple of 34. If am correct\nTeacher Turn 9: Your calculation is correct, but it is not applying what we know about multiples correctly... To be a multiple of a number, you have to multiply it by another number. So to be a multiple of 34, you have to be able to complete this calculation... 34 x ___ = Multiple. 34 is a multiple, because 34 x 1 = 34\nStudent Turn 9: Okay. Thank you\nTeacher Turn 10: 102 is a multiple, because 34 x 3 = 102\nStudent Turn 10: Yh I meant it but I didn\u2019t know how to explain it\nTeacher Turn 11: And we have to multiply by a whole number, no fractions or decimal.

We add to get the perimeter. No multiplying when finding the perimeter \ud83d\ude03\nStudent Turn 15: No I mean the 5x. don\u2019t we need to do 5 times x\nTeacher Turn 16: 5x means we have 5 lots of x. 5x + 4x + x = 10x\nStudent Turn 16: Ohhhhh.

Does that make sense?\nStudent Turn 2: Yes\ud83d\ude03\nTeacher Turn 3: Awesome, so we can compare that size to all our other bars.

And Sophie is looking at p, so if we kind of drew a line down from the end of one purple bar, how many white bars does it include? :)\nStudent Turn 3: 4\nTeacher Turn 4: Perfect!

She said w = 4p, rather than 4w = p\nStudent Turn 5: Ohh no it doesn\u2019t\nTeacher Turn 6: Great, so Sophie is wrong, because it should be 4w = p :).

How can I help?\nStudent Turn 1: I don\u2019t understand\nTeacher Turn 2: Not a problem. I'll just take a look at what you're working on. One moment... Ok! Have you got access to a calculator?\nStudent Turn 2: Yes\nTeacher Turn 3: Great! Let's start with the %. If we start with 100% and get 5% interest, what % is that?\nStudent Turn 3: 650\nTeacher Turn 4: That is 5% you're correct, but have another read of my question. If you HAVE 100% and someone GIVES YOU 5%, what total % do you have?\nStudent Turn 4: 105\nTeacher Turn 5: Brilliant! Do you know what 105% is as a decimal?\nStudent Turn 5: 1.05\nTeacher Turn 6: Exactly! So to increase by 5% we multiply by 1.05. ut that would be for 1 year. *But\nStudent Turn 6: Ok\nTeacher Turn 7: How many years are in this question?\nStudent Turn 7: 4\nTeacher Turn 8: Great. So we would do 13000 x 1.05 x 1.05 x 1.05 x 1.05. But that takes a while to type. Is there a quicker way rather than typing it out 4 times?\nStudent Turn 8: X4\nTeacher Turn 9: Not quite. 5 x 5 can be written as 5^2. Can you apply that to 1.05 x 1.05 x 1.05 x 1.05?\nStudent Turn 9: Not sure\nTeacher Turn 10: So if something keeps multiplying by itself we can use a power. So 1.05 x 1.05 x 1.05 x 1.05 would be 1.05^4. Does that make sense?\nStudent Turn 10: Ok\nTeacher Turn 11: So you need to type in 13000 x 1.05^4 on your calculator. 13000 is the original money. 1.05 because that is 105%. and 4 for the years.

Which one would simplify to a whole number?\nStudent Turn 8: i dont know\nTeacher Turn 9: We could rewrite the rt25 just as 5. So we get rt3 x 5. So that is 5rt3 not 3rt5. Because the 5 is the whole number, that goes infront of the surd. And the 3 is still under the root sign\nStudent Turn 9: oh ok i just did 75 divided by 5 which gave me 15 and then i made that into a rt\nTeacher Turn 10: oh ok! Let's go over that step. When simplifying surds we need to look at whether we can divide by any square numbers. We are only EVER interested in finding square factors when it comes to surds. So when I saw 75 I realised I could divide by the square number 25 to get 25 x 3\nStudent Turn 10: oke\nTeacher Turn 11: What if I asked you to simplify rt200.

So we have to figure out what we would multiply 9 by to get 6.  That will be our scale factor.  Then we can multiply 7.5 by that scale factor to find the missing side.

P - 3 x 2. p-3x2\nStudent Turn 6: Could I use bodmas\nTeacher Turn 7: It has to be in that order. so in words, p take away 3, then multiply by 2. if we look at Jack's answer, 2(p-3)\nStudent Turn 7: So would it be 2(p-3\nTeacher Turn 8: how would you describe this in words?\nStudent Turn 8: P take away3 multiply by 2\nTeacher Turn 9: good!! \ud83d\udc4f so that matches what you said. could Lily be right?\nStudent Turn 9: Maybe no\nTeacher Turn 10: Why?\nStudent Turn 10: Because 2p -6 isn't the same as p-3x2\nTeacher Turn 11: as you said before 2(p-3) can be expanded to 2p-6 but in this question, 2p-6 wouldn't be the output\nStudent Turn 11: So could Lily be wrong but Jack is right\nTeacher Turn 12: I would agree with you here, but we know that Lily's answer is Jack's answer expanded\nStudent Turn 12: So are both right\nTeacher Turn 13: If we go through the function machine, would we get 2p-6 at the end? these questions are designed to make you really think, and you've really done that!\nStudent Turn 13: I do not really understand how both answers are right please\nTeacher Turn 14: follow the function machine... p - 3 x 2. to complete the steps in that order, p-3 must be done first, hence the brackets used in Jack's answer. the output = 2(p-3). we can now expand this output to get 2p - 6, BUT 2p-6 isn't a direct output from what was inputted. It's a confusing one, but I think you are right with Jack\nStudent Turn 14: But I wrote that and Jack was correct and i did not get it right\nTeacher Turn 15: so in this case, 2p-6 is another potential answer\nStudent Turn 15: Okay i get it\nTeacher Turn 16: what answer would you select?\nStudent Turn 16: Both are correct\nTeacher Turn 17: ok good work Chijioke \ud83d\ude0a. can i help you with anything else today?\nStudent Turn 17: No thank you\n[END DIALOGUE]\n\nYour final response should have an entry for exactly 17 turns (1-17).", "[BEGIN PROBLEM]\nQuestion Text: Expand: \\[ 6(p-2) \\]\nAnswer A Text: \\( 6 p-2 \\)\nAnswer B Text: \\( 6 p-12 \\)\nAnswer C Text: \\( p-12 \\)\nAnswer D Text: \\( 6 p-4 \\)\n[END PROBLEM]\n\n[BEGIN DIALOGUE]\nTeacher Turn 1: Hello Maggie \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4b.

Or really it means 16 divided by 3\nStudent Turn 25: Wouldn\u2019t what be 5.2 or something. That*\nTeacher Turn 26: Yeah 5.3333333333.., but because that's not a whole number writing it as a fraction keeps it accurate\nStudent Turn 26: Ah ok\nTeacher Turn 27: It's useful to know the decimal for plotting it on the graph though! So we had -4/3 times 4 - 1, and now we know that's -5.3333 - 1, which is?\nStudent Turn 27: 4.3333333\nTeacher Turn 28: Careful, it's negative again\nStudent Turn 28: -4.3333\nTeacher Turn 29: -5 - 1?\nStudent Turn 29: -4\nTeacher Turn 30: Down the number line remember\nStudent Turn 30: -6\nTeacher Turn 31: That's it, so -5.3333 - 1 =\nStudent Turn 31: 6.3333\nTeacher Turn 32: Great, -6.333, can you plot that on your graph or do we still need to go smaller?

Each time we do two steps: times our x number by -4/3, then subtract 1. Let's do x = 1. 1 x -4/3?\nStudent Turn 35: -12?\nTeacher Turn 36: Hmm it might be less confusing as a decimal: 1 x -1.3333?\nStudent Turn 36: 1.333333\nTeacher Turn 37: Yeah that's it, just don't forget the -. And then subtract 1\nStudent Turn 37: Oh ye. -0.33333\nTeacher Turn 38: -1.33333 - 1\nStudent Turn 38: -2.3333\nTeacher Turn 39: You got it! (1, -2.333). Nearly there, last one - using decimals definitely seems clearer. So let's do x = 2. 2 x -1.3333?\nStudent Turn 39: And then I just need 2 points for y=1/4x+1\nTeacher Turn 40: Oh ok do you have enough for that question?\nStudent Turn 40: Sorry no I miss phrased it it said plot the following 3 lines. Not 3 points for each\nTeacher Turn 41: No worries, still good practice! So you can plot that first line, right?\nStudent Turn 41: Yup\nTeacher Turn 42: Let's look at the next one - do you know what the +1 at the end tells us that helps with drawing it?\nStudent Turn 42: It means add 1 to the final answer\nTeacher Turn 43: Yep, so when x = 0, we have 1/4 x 0 then +1, what's that?\nStudent Turn 43: 1 1/4\nTeacher Turn 44: (1/4 is 0.25 if that helps)\nStudent Turn 44: 1.25\nTeacher Turn 45: 0/25 x 0 + 1?\nStudent Turn 45: 0.25? ohh no just 1\nTeacher Turn 46: That's it, good self-correction \ud83d\ude01\nStudent Turn 46: Thanks \ud83d\ude03\nTeacher Turn 47: So we have the point (0,1) to start\nStudent Turn 47: \ud83d\udc4d\nTeacher Turn 48: Let's do x = 2, so y = 0.25 x 2 + 1\nStudent Turn 48: 1.5\nTeacher Turn 49: That's the one \ud83d\ude0a.

You seem to just be guessing the answer\nStudent Turn 7: D\nTeacher Turn 8: The answer is D. A polygon with n sides can be split into n - 2 triangles, and the angles in each of those triangles add up to 180 degrees. So the total of all the angles in the polygon is (n-2) x 180\nStudent Turn 8: 26\nTeacher Turn 9: I'm going to let you go back and carry on working through the lesson now\nStudent Turn 9: I don\u2019t need help\n[END DIALOGUE]\n\nYour final response should have an entry for exactly 9 turns (1-9).", "[BEGIN PROBLEM]\nQuestion Text: Liam and Emma are discussing similar shapes\nQuestion Text: Liam says these two shapes are similar:\nQuestion Image: Two scalene triangles.

Are you confident with the meaning of \"similar shapes\"?\nStudent Turn 2: Yes\nTeacher Turn 3: OK, so let's look at the shapes.  If we look at Liam's shapes first:. Liam's triangles are 4,5,6 cm   and 3,4,5 cm. How can I work out if those 2 triangles are similar?\nStudent Turn 3: ?\nTeacher Turn 4: So, first,we have to make sure we're comparing the same sides.  So, in Liam's triangles, the base of the first triangle is 5 cm.  How long is the corresponding side in the 2nd triangle?\nStudent Turn 4: 4cm\nTeacher Turn 5: Good, we have to work out what we could multiply the smaller measurement with (4cm) to get the bigger measurement (5cm).  Could you do that?\nStudent Turn 5: No\nTeacher Turn 6: Ok, to work that out, we need to do 5 divided by 4.  It says no calculator, but I think we'll use a calculator for this because it's more important we concentrate on the similar shapes at the moment. What is 5 divided by 4? Do you have a calculator, or you can work it out yourself?\nStudent Turn 6: 1.25\nTeacher Turn 7: Great.  So if the 2 triangles are similar, all the sides of the smaller triangle will have been multiplied by the same number to get the lengths of the larger triangle.  So, let's test this out.\nStudent Turn 7: Okay\nTeacher Turn 8: So, try multiplying the other 2 sides of Liam's smaller triangle by 1.25, do you get the lengths of the larger triangle?\nStudent Turn 8: Liam is not correct\nTeacher Turn 9: Great!  Now, repeat this process for Emma.  Looking at the bases of the triangles, what would you multiply 5 by to get 7.5?\nStudent Turn 9: 1.5\nTeacher Turn 10: Well done Sanjana! Now try multiplying the other 2 sides of Emma's small triangle by 1.5, do you get the measurements of the larger triangle?\nStudent Turn 10: Emma is  correct\nTeacher Turn 11: You've done brilliantly, Sanjana, well done!

She should have written m - 4 = 80, not m - 1 = 80\nStudent Turn 23: oh okay. is it d\nTeacher Turn 24: So that's why Emma is wrong (whatever Zane may have said).\nStudent Turn 24: lolllll\nTeacher Turn 25: Well, let's talk about Leo's statement then. That's why I was interested in whether Zane had given any reasons.\nStudent Turn 25: i want to go stock up my jewelry for my business\nTeacher Turn 26: So Leo says m/4 - 1 = 20 can be turned into m/4 = 21. What has he done to both sides there?\nStudent Turn 26: \ud83d\ude2b\nTeacher Turn 27: Oh, OK, does that mean you need to go? We're not far off done\nStudent Turn 27: its ok\nTeacher Turn 28: Ok, so Leo says m/4 - 1 = 20 can be turned into m/4 = 21. What's changed on the left hand side?\nStudent Turn 28: you can continue x\nTeacher Turn 29: The left hand side has gone from m/4 - 1 to m/4, so what's changeD?\nStudent Turn 29: no subtraction\nTeacher Turn 30: That's correct. What's the opposite of subtracting 1?\nStudent Turn 30: multiplying\nTeacher Turn 31: Hmmm... multiplying is the opposite of dividing, not of subtracting. What's the opposite of subtracting?\nStudent Turn 31: additionnnnn\nTeacher Turn 32: Yes it is! So I think Leo added 1 to the left hand side. and that made the -1 disappear. because -1 + 1 = ?\nStudent Turn 32: leo is righttttttt. 0\nTeacher Turn 33: It is!\nStudent Turn 33: becuase it cancels it out. typo\nTeacher Turn 34: And did he remember to add 1 to the other side?\nStudent Turn 34: no\nTeacher Turn 35: What happened to the right hand side?\nStudent Turn 35: division\nTeacher Turn 36: What was on the right hand side and what did it change to?\nStudent Turn 36: 211. 21\nTeacher Turn 37: Yes, it became 21. What was it before?\nStudent Turn 37: whats the answer\nTeacher Turn 38: Originally the equation was m/4 - 1 = ?\nStudent Turn 38: im tiredddd. bye lena. thanks for being awesokeeee. awesomee\nTeacher Turn 39: You're done? That's a shame, we were so close!\nStudent Turn 39: i knpow but we wasted 14 ,minjutess\nTeacher Turn 40: The right hand side went from 20 to 21, so Leo DID remember to add 1.\nStudent Turn 40: byeee x\nTeacher Turn 41: I didn't think it was wasted.\nStudent Turn 41: no i didnt mean it in a rude way\nTeacher Turn 42: Why don't we finish so you can answer this question and move on?\nStudent Turn 42: ohhhhh so leo is right\nTeacher Turn 43: Yes, he correctly added 1 to both sides.

(m + 100) + (2m -n) + (260 -2m). This is the 3 angles added together, can you simplify this?\nStudent Turn 16: yes\nTeacher Turn 17: Great, let me know what you get \ud83d\udc4d\nStudent Turn 17: 120 degrees each i think\nTeacher Turn 18: Sorry, I mean...can you collect the like terms together:\nStudent Turn 18: yes\nTeacher Turn 19: m + 100 + 2m -n + 260 -2m. What do you get?\nStudent Turn 19: 360 + m - n\nTeacher Turn 20: Great! So, we know that:. 360 + m - n = 360\nStudent Turn 20: so m and n = 0\nTeacher Turn 21: Not quite.... I think you've taken 360 away from both sides, so you get this:. m - n = 0. Does that make sense?\nStudent Turn 21: no\nTeacher Turn 22: Ok, let's go back a step \ud83d\udc4d. 360 + m - n = 360. So we got this \u2b06\ufe0f. Becuase we added all the angles together and got 360 + m - n. And we know that all the angles must add up to 360. Therefore:. 360 + m - n = 360. Now we need to simplify this if we can\nStudent Turn 22: how?\nTeacher Turn 23: To simplify this equation, we must do the same to both sides. You noticed that there is 360 on both sides\nStudent Turn 23: yes\nTeacher Turn 24: So, we can subtract 360 from both sides of the equation. And it will remain equal\nStudent Turn 24: m-n\nTeacher Turn 25: Yes, great\nStudent Turn 25: so is m-n the answer\nTeacher Turn 26: And on the right hand side, when we take away 360?\nStudent Turn 26: Its A\nTeacher Turn 27: No, we need to keep the equation.

For example let's try 3000 instead, I think that might be easier.  What is 3000 divided by 30?\nStudent Turn 3: 300. I think. 0. ?\nTeacher Turn 4: Nearly, it's 100, does that make sense?  3000/10 = 300, so 3000/30 would be 100\nStudent Turn 4: Oh ok\nTeacher Turn 5: So, 3000/30 = 100.  Now let's see if dividing by 30 is the same as dividing by 30 3 times....\nStudent Turn 5: \ud83d\ude05\nTeacher Turn 6: What is 3000/10\nStudent Turn 6: 300\nTeacher Turn 7: Great, now divide by 10 again...\nStudent Turn 7: 30\nTeacher Turn 8: And again....\nStudent Turn 8: 3\nTeacher Turn 9: Great, so is \u00f730, the same as \u00f710 3 times?\nStudent Turn 9: Yeah\nTeacher Turn 10: But we found that 3000\u00f730=100 and 3000\u00f710\u00f710\u00f710=3, so is \u00f730 the same as \u00f710\u00f710\u00f710?\nStudent Turn 10: Yes\u2026mab. maybe. ????\nTeacher Turn 11: But we got different answers when we divided by 30 and when we divided by 10 3 times.\nStudent Turn 11: Oh right\nTeacher Turn 12: Can you see that?  Dividing by 10 three times is actually the same as dividing by 1000, because 10x10x10=1000.\nStudent Turn 12: Ohok\nTeacher Turn 13: So when Emma suggests \u00f710\u00f73, this would be the same as dividing by what number?\nStudent Turn 13: Nonono.

And similarly if we multiply a number by 3 and then by 10, it's the same as multiplying by 30. And division is the inverse (opposite) of multiplying, so \u00f710\u00f73 is the same as \u00f730. Does this make sense?\nStudent Turn 17: Ok. ? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\nTeacher Turn 18: This is a tricky one....let's have another think... So the idea of this question is to work out whether \u00f730 is the same as either of these: \u00f710\u00f710\u00f710    OR \u00f73\u00f710. Are you happy with what the question is asking?\nStudent Turn 18: Yres\nTeacher Turn 19: Ok, great.\nStudent Turn 19: thx\nTeacher Turn 20: So... \u00f730 is the same as dividing by (3x10) because 30 is 3x10. Is that ok?\nStudent Turn 20: ok\nTeacher Turn 21: But \u00f710\u00f710\u00f710 is the same as dividing by 10x10x10 which is 1000.\nStudent Turn 21: Yes ok\u2026\nTeacher Turn 22: So, therefore, in the question you're doing: 2010\u00f730\nStudent Turn 22: Lila has a big fat butt. Sorry my sister typing it. not my fault ignore. pls\nTeacher Turn 23: Oh, I see....try not to let her because this account is in your name, but yes I will ignore.\nStudent Turn 23: ?\nTeacher Turn 24: ok, so 2010\u00f730 = 2010\u00f73\u00f710\nStudent Turn 24: Okoki. ok\nTeacher Turn 25: The videos above explain this process so you might find it makes more sense if you watch those again.

B. b. b\nTeacher Turn 3: 120 is correct for now but the final answer isn't B. so we know that 8x15=120. now think about how we actually ahve 0.15 and not 15. so what do we divide 15 by to get 0.15?\nStudent Turn 3: i dont know\nTeacher Turn 4: it's ok, let me tell you. if we do 15 divided by 100 we get 0.15. and also in the question we have 0.8 and not 8, ... so now see if we can figure out what we divide 8 by to get 0.8. the way I'm doing this question with you is spotting that we know the answer to 8x15 and then seeing how to change it to get the answer to 0.8x0.15. and how we do it is see that instead of 8 we need 0.8 which is 10 times smaller than 8.... and instead of 15 we have 0.15 which is 100 times smaller than 15... and so the answer to 0.8x0.15 will be 1000 times smaller than 120. A different way to do this quetsion is to use the fact that it is multiple choice, and to think about how we can work out 1x0.15. what is 1x0.15=?\nStudent Turn 4: 0.15\nTeacher Turn 5: great, yes it is. and so if we know that 1x0.15=0.15 then we know ... because 0.8 is smaller than 1, the answer to 0.8x0.15 will be smaller than the answer to 1x0.15. but only slightly smaller. which of the options is slightly smaller than 0.15?

It's, for example, that if C is inversely proportional to D, then C=1/D.  I think that's what you mean by opposite.\nStudent Turn 5: Yes it is haha\nTeacher Turn 6: :-). OK, so now your question... So, C is inversely proportional to D, this can be written as C=x/D. I'm introducing x, because it doesn't have to be a 1 as the numerator, it could be any number. We're going to work out x first, so that we have a full equation for C and D. So when C=3, D=8, let's put that into the equation above:. 3=x/8.

How can I be of help?\nStudent Turn 1: I don\u2019t understand this topic\nTeacher Turn 2: Alright, let's have a look at it together. We're estimating these to 1 significant figure.  Does that sound familiar to you?\nStudent Turn 2: Yes  my math teacher has mentioned it but I don\u2019t really get it when it\u2019s like a fraction\nTeacher Turn 3: That's great you know about it! If you'd like, don't think of this problem as a fraction.  Instead, think of it as a multiplication and division problem. Would you like to work through it together?\nStudent Turn 3: It looks like a fraction because of the line so it confused me and yes I would like to work on it\nTeacher Turn 4: Alright, we can start by estimating or rounding the numbers in our problem to one significant figure.\nStudent Turn 4: Ok\nTeacher Turn 5: Our first number is 4.12.  Would you like to try rounding it?  Or shall we do the first one together?\nStudent Turn 5: I will try. Is it 0\nTeacher Turn 6: It is not...\nStudent Turn 6: Can you go trough it with me please\nTeacher Turn 7: Of course! We are rounding it to 1 significant figure, which means we keep the first number and round with the second. In this case that would be 4.1. What number does 4.1 round to, to one significant figure?\nStudent Turn 7: 4\nTeacher Turn 8: Well done! Next up is 18.3. Again, looking at the first two digits we have 18.\nStudent Turn 8: Would it be 18\nTeacher Turn 9: We have 18 and we need to round it to 1 significant digit. What would 18 round to?\nStudent Turn 9: 20\nTeacher Turn 10: Well done Saira! Alright, the last one is 0.226. Want to try that one?\nStudent Turn 10: Yes. 0.2 ?\nTeacher Turn 11: Great job! \ud83d\ude04. That leaves us with our estimated problem... (4 x 20) / 0.2. Now we calculate it out to find our estimated solution. Would you like to try to calculate it?\nStudent Turn 11: So would you do 4x2 wich is 8 and add a 0 so it\u2019s 80\nTeacher Turn 12: Right!  80 on top and divide it by 0.2\nStudent Turn 12: I\u2019m not quite sure\nTeacher Turn 13: Now we have 80 / 0.2. If it helps, you can add a place value to each one. In this case it would be 800 / 2\nStudent Turn 13: Would it be 2.8\nTeacher Turn 14: If we add a place value to each one, it keeps the problem intact. It is not 2.8...\nStudent Turn 14: So 16 or 1.6\nTeacher Turn 15: Not quite...\nStudent Turn 15: Wait never mind. 4\nTeacher Turn 16: Closer!

What is 4.12 to 1 significant figure?\nStudent Turn 22: 3\nTeacher Turn 23: You're right that we would have a single digit but it wouldn't be 3\nStudent Turn 23: Is it 4\nTeacher Turn 24: It is, well done. Now the 18.3 to 1 significant figure?\nStudent Turn 24: 18\nTeacher Turn 25: That would be 2 significant figures. The 1st significant figure in 18.3 is the 1\nStudent Turn 25: 2\nTeacher Turn 26: Almost, what does the 1 in 18.3 represent?\nStudent Turn 26: 100\nTeacher Turn 27: in 18.3 the 1 is 10. Are you happy with that?\nStudent Turn 27: Right so would it be 20\nTeacher Turn 28: Perfect! We have to keep the same place value \ud83d\ude42. So we now have 4 x 20 on the top of the fraction.\nStudent Turn 28: 80\nTeacher Turn 29: Fab! Now what does 0.226 round to?\nStudent Turn 29: 200. Or 220\nTeacher Turn 30: Think about the place value. It's not 200, it's 0.2\nStudent Turn 30: Ohhh I get it now\nTeacher Turn 31: Fantastic! When rounding we must keep the place value the same.

If we went backwards one step and multiplied that by 3, it would get us back to the total, right?\nStudent Turn 5: \ud83d\udc4d\nTeacher Turn 6: So any time you are given the mean, you can multiply by how many numbers there are to find the total\nStudent Turn 6: ok\nTeacher Turn 7: In the question you were looking at, the mean is 4 and there are 5 numbers in the list, so what is the total?\nStudent Turn 7: idk\nTeacher Turn 8: Take the mean and multiply by how many numbers there are\nStudent Turn 8: 16?\nTeacher Turn 9: Almost, but we still include the mystery number when we're counting them, so it's 4 x 5\nStudent Turn 9: 20?\nTeacher Turn 10: Exactly. So now you know the total is 20, you need to see what is missing from the list to make it add up to 20\nStudent Turn 10: ok\nTeacher Turn 11: So far you have 2 + 3 + 8 + 6\nStudent Turn 11: ok\nTeacher Turn 12: Can you tell what is missing to make 20? Calculate what they add up to so far.\nStudent Turn 12: 1\nTeacher Turn 13: That's it!!\nStudent Turn 13: \ud83d\ude00\nTeacher Turn 14: So that's your answer.

I would expect 499 to be just below 500, not above it\nStudent Turn 7: yeah its below it not above it cause its less....\nTeacher Turn 8: great, so I don't think B is correct. What about C? Can you find the value of the middle dash?\nStudent Turn 8: im just confused at this point\nTeacher Turn 9: Ok. In B we worked out that the middle dash would be 500. Therefore we would expect 499 to be just left of it because it is smaller.

She shares the apples out between them so that they each have the same amount. so there are 6 equal groups of apples\nStudent Turn 3: Ok\nTeacher Turn 4: Would it be possible for her to do that if she had 6 apples?\nStudent Turn 4: No because it say's she has one left over. But if she didn't have one left over then yes she could\nTeacher Turn 5: Super, because they would each get 1 and we would have none left over. So what number of apples would leave her with one left over?\nStudent Turn 5: 6. no 5\nTeacher Turn 6: If she had 5 apples, she could start handing them out, but the last friend wouldn't get one. So she would actually have 0 equal groups and 5 left over.

How many apples would she need to share out so that each friend gets 2?\nStudent Turn 8: 66\nTeacher Turn 9: not quite. Try drawing it out on a piece of paper. draw six circles, one for each friend\nStudent Turn 9: ok\nTeacher Turn 10: Now put 1 dot in each circle\nStudent Turn 10: let me draw it\nTeacher Turn 11: Ok let me know when you're ready\nStudent Turn 11: done\nTeacher Turn 12: Super!

How many do we now have in total?\nStudent Turn 14: she has 12 apples so far\nTeacher Turn 15: Great! So this represents Hannah sharing out 12 apples and there are none left over.

It's the beginning of the 6 times tables\nStudent Turn 18: yes I do. oki\nTeacher Turn 19: So this means that if her total apples is in the 6 times tables then they'll be shared equally with none left over. For her to have 1 left over she would have to have started with a number in the 6 times table, but plus an extra one. So instead of 6, 12, 18, she could have started with 7, 13, or 19\nStudent Turn 19: I think I know the awnser\nTeacher Turn 20: Do you see how that would mean she would have 1 left over after sharing them out? Great! What do you think it will be?\nStudent Turn 20: 30 maybe\nTeacher Turn 21: Is 30 in the 6 times table?\nStudent Turn 21: yes\nTeacher Turn 22: So that means she will be able to share them into 6 equal groups with none left over\nStudent Turn 22: 6*5\nTeacher Turn 23: But we want 1 left over\nStudent Turn 23: But theres no 31. *there's*\nTeacher Turn 24: No, but you're correct that 31 could be a possible answer. let's check the next one. Is 35 in the 6 times table?\nStudent Turn 24: so could it be 35\nTeacher Turn 25: If we take 1 away from 35 do we get a number that is in the six times table?\nStudent Turn 25: no\nTeacher Turn 26: so it's not going to be 35. What about 43? If we take 1 away from 43 do we get a number that is in the 6 times table?\nStudent Turn 26: it's 43\nTeacher Turn 27: Great! Because 42 is 6x7 so would give us 6 equal groups of 7.

So what do I need to do\nTeacher Turn 4: Even though Mike rounded the 15 down, we are still going to be a little bit bigger than if we just left the answers as is.  Do you have an idea why>?\nStudent Turn 4: No\nTeacher Turn 5: Well, if we used easier numbers, it might be easier to spot.  Let's say I had 12 pens.  If I divided by 4, how many would I have?\nStudent Turn 5: 3\nTeacher Turn 6: If I rounded my number down and took 12 divided by 3, would I have more or less as an answer?\nStudent Turn 6: More since it\u2019s 4\nTeacher Turn 7: Good!  Let's apply that idea to our bigger numbers.  Even though it seems like reducing 15.3282 to 15 should make a smaller answer, because we are DIVIDING by that, we are going to get a bigger answer, because we are dividing by a smaller amount.\nStudent Turn 7: Ok\nTeacher Turn 8: So in this case, both Liz and Mike are correct in their statements.
