I've done the factors of 16, now it's your turn to do the factors of 24 so we can find the HCF of 24 and 16 \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d\nStudent Turn 7: 1x24. 2x12\nTeacher Turn 8: Amazing \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01. 3 x ?\nStudent Turn 8: 4x6. 3x8\nTeacher Turn 9: WOOOOOOOOO \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a. Brilliant stuff!\nStudent Turn 9: Thanks\nTeacher Turn 10: So now looking at both lists what is the highest number that's in both of them?! 1, 24, 2, 12, 3, 8, 4, 6. 1, 16, 2, 8, 4\nStudent Turn 10: 8?\nTeacher Turn 11: Yipppppeeee \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc4d. Well spotted! So to factorise 24a - 16. We know we're going to start by taking out a factor of 8 \u2705\u2705\u2705\u2705. 8 x ? = 24a\nStudent Turn 11: 4?\nTeacher Turn 12: 8 x 4 = 32. Maybe use the answers from the question to help \ud83d\ude0a. We know the factorisation will start 8 ( __________ ) because we know 8 is the highest common factor \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc4d. 8 x ? = 24a and 8 x ? = -16 \ud83e\udde0\nStudent Turn 12: -8\nTeacher Turn 13: 8 x 3a = 24a \ud83d\ude0a. 8 x -2 = -16 \ud83d\ude0a. Do they make sense?\nStudent Turn 13: Ye\nTeacher Turn 14: Awesome so 24a - 16 factorised is: 8 (3a - 2) \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\nStudent Turn 14: Ok\n[END DIALOGUE]\n\nYour final response should have an entry for exactly 14 turns (1-14).", "[BEGIN PROBLEM]\nQuestion Text: How many terms are greater than zero in this sequence: \\[ 16-3 n \\]\nAnswer A Text: \\( 13 \\)\nAnswer B Text: \\( 6 \\)\nAnswer C Text: \\( 16 \\)\nAnswer D Text: \\( 5 \\)\n[END PROBLEM]\n\n[BEGIN DIALOGUE]\nTeacher Turn 1: Hello Isabella :)\nStudent Turn 1: Hello Sophia :) I don't understand...\nTeacher Turn 2: You have been doing some wonderful work on the rest of the lesson.

The greater than zero part\nTeacher Turn 3: Ok so just like the hint has said for this question we should think about the first few terms of the sequence. If the nth term is 16-3n what is the first term?\nStudent Turn 3: I'm not sure\nTeacher Turn 4: That is ok Isabella, not to worry. When we want the first term of a sequence we replace n with 1. So for this sequence that would be 16 - (3 times 1).... which is?\nStudent Turn 4: 3\nTeacher Turn 5: Not quite, lets take step by step\ud83d\ude01. So the nth term for this sequence means that we have 16 takeaway 3 times n. When we want the first term, n is 1. So I would start with what is 3 times 1?\nStudent Turn 5: oh so 3x1 is 3 then 16-3 is 13\nTeacher Turn 6: Nailed it, well done Isabella\ud83d\udcaa. So 13 is the first term, do you know what the second term would be?\nStudent Turn 6: are we descending?\nTeacher Turn 7: Yes, the reason we know this is what is attached to the \"n\" in the nth term. It is a \"-3\" this tells us that the sequence is decreasing by 3 each time\nStudent Turn 7: 10. ?\nTeacher Turn 8: Excellent :). So we know the first two terms: 13,10,... Can you find the next 4? 13, 10, ___, ___, ____, ___\nStudent Turn 8: 7, 4, 1, -2\nTeacher Turn 9: Brilliant so we have the sequence is 13,10,7 ,4 ,1, -2.... and it keeps going. The question asked you how many of those terms are greater than zero. in other words, how many positive numbers. How many do you see Isabella in the list?\nStudent Turn 9: 5\nTeacher Turn 10: Excellent, so the answer above would be (D) 5.

She has taken away 11... If you read the question she is trying to take away 9 so does her method work? \ud83d\udc40\nStudent Turn 9: no\nTeacher Turn 10: Exactly \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4c. So Sarah's method doesn't work she takes away 11 instead of 9! So she can't be correct. Now let's look at Jake's method. He wants to add 9...

Ivy is AI\nTeacher Turn 3: So if let's go through the different options by trying a number each time. If we multiply 2 by 99 we would get 198. Let's now try method A.

So this doesn't give us the same answer, so method B is incorrect. Method C tells us to multiply by 100 and subtract 1. 2 x 100 and subtract 1 is?\nStudent Turn 10: 99. 199\nTeacher Turn 11: Perfect and finally. Method D tells us to multiply by 100 and add 1.

I'm here to help \ud83d\ude03\nStudent Turn 2: ok. yay\nTeacher Turn 3: Let's have a look at this question. So we have a semicircle. If t is halfway across the line, then t is the radius of the circle. Can you see that?\nStudent Turn 3: yes\nTeacher Turn 4: Great. Now let's split the perimeter into the arc (the curved bit) and the straight line. The arc is half of the circumference of the full circle. Circ = 2 x pi x r, so half of this would just be pi x r. Are you happy with that?\nStudent Turn 4: yes shall i do 2xpi?\nTeacher Turn 5: No we can't actually work it out because we don't know what radius is. We're just forming an equation\nStudent Turn 5: ohh k\nTeacher Turn 6: SO the length of the arc is pi x r. But remember we said the radius is t, so we can write it as t\u03c0. Is that ok?\nStudent Turn 6: yes\nTeacher Turn 7: \ud83d\udc4d. What about the length of the straight line?\nStudent Turn 7: \ud83d\udc4d. is t right?\nTeacher Turn 8: That's half of the length\nStudent Turn 8: oh but we need to figure it out then\nTeacher Turn 9: We can't figure t out\nStudent Turn 9: oh\nTeacher Turn 10: For now we just want to work out an expression in terms of t for the length of the straight line. If half of the line is t, what is the whole line? It would be 2t\nStudent Turn 10: could you explain that again please. i didnt quit understand\nTeacher Turn 11: Yes. If you look at the diagram, and the question, it says the distance t is half way across the horizontal line. So in total, the length of the horizontal line must be 2t, so that half of it is t\nStudent Turn 11: oh ok\nTeacher Turn 12: Are you happy with that now?\nStudent Turn 12: yes\nTeacher Turn 13: Ok, good. So the total perimeter is arc length + straight line. That's \u03c0t + 2t.

By squaring root x, you end up with just x. You then square the right hand side\nStudent Turn 5: so is squarinng just to the power of 2 you would write it as\nTeacher Turn 6: yes!\nStudent Turn 6: okay dokie so x = 3t \\. sorry 3t ^ 2\nTeacher Turn 7: remember, all of the 3t needs to be squared, not just the t!\nStudent Turn 7: so 3t squared t 2. t squared sorry\nTeacher Turn 8: as in B? you're saying that is the incorrect one?\nStudent Turn 8: oh wait so x = 3t squared. is correct right. but we are asked for incorrect\nTeacher Turn 9: how do you show that all parts need to be squared? not just to last term?\nStudent Turn 9: oh oh bracketss. my teacher told me this today\nTeacher Turn 10: yes perfect!\nStudent Turn 10: so D has to be correct\nTeacher Turn 11: so the easiest way to show it is x = (3t)^2. yes D is correct. When you are squaring a bracket, that means everything inside has to be squared. So 3^2 and t^2\nStudent Turn 11: so oneof A B OR C is wrong. can A be correct as it is still right i think\nTeacher Turn 12: yes that's right! A is a correct answer\nStudent Turn 12: wait hold on no. oh yes. i was going to say no but then i realised A just means 3 squared + t squared\nTeacher Turn 13: so we know it isn't A or D. what about B and C?\nStudent Turn 13: so Amust be correct. I think C is. ummm. i thought because we are multiplying power of 2 both sides right\nTeacher Turn 14: Yes C is correct as 3^2 = 9\nStudent Turn 14: so 3 ^ 2 is 9. and t ^ 2\nTeacher Turn 15: good so C must be correct!\nStudent Turn 15: so B must be wrong as it just makes it seem like only t is being to the power of 2. but in C would it not be 9 ^2 t^2. oh no it wouldnt\nTeacher Turn 16: it wouldn't be 9^2 as it is already squared to get the 9\nStudent Turn 16: 3 ^ 2 9 and t ^ 2 is t squared = 9 ^t2\nTeacher Turn 17: good, so is C correct?\nStudent Turn 17: yes and b is wrong i understand now :D\nTeacher Turn 18: perfect, well done Nina!\nStudent Turn 18: Thanks claire :D ill do another topic related to this tomorrow :)\nTeacher Turn 19: sounds good!

So when we measure density we need two things.....mass and volume. Can you give me measurements of mass Farhan?\nStudent Turn 11: gram, kilogram, tonnes, milligram\nTeacher Turn 12: Amazing. Now lets think of volume. we could have centimetres cubed, mlllimetres cubed, km cubed.... If we look at the options above are there any that don't have mass or a volume?\nStudent Turn 12: so its a\nTeacher Turn 13: Brilliant Farhan :). Super!!! Because it says squared so it is not a volume\nStudent Turn 13: but wait a second. d also says metre. its not volume nor mass\nTeacher Turn 14: Milligrams per millimetre cubed. The difference is the millimetre is cubed. Whereas in A the unit of length is squared....not cubed\nStudent Turn 14: got it, thank you\n[END DIALOGUE]\n\nYour final response should have an entry for exactly 14 turns (1-14).", "[BEGIN PROBLEM]\nQuestion Text: Jake and Emma are discussing similarity.

I do not understand how fo work out this question\nTeacher Turn 2: So this question is about similarity, which is not the same as congruence. Two shapes are similar if one is an enlargement of the other. Which means we need to look at the ratio, or scale factor between sides. Let's look at Jake's rectangles first\nStudent Turn 2: Is it d\nTeacher Turn 3: No it isn't, lets work through it together. On Jake's rectangles, the shorter side on the first rectangle is 4 cm and the shorter side on the second rectangle is 6 cm. So the scale factor is 6/4 which is 1.5. So the scale factor is 6/4 which is 1.5. Which means the shorter side on the second rectangle is 1.5 times longer than the shorter side on the first rectangle. Are you happy so far?\nStudent Turn 3: Yes\nTeacher Turn 4: Great\nStudent Turn 4: So it's b right\nTeacher Turn 5: Why do you think it's B?\nStudent Turn 5: Because they are both in the two times table and 4 to 10 is getting larger\nTeacher Turn 6: But we need to work out exactly how many times larger, so we can see if its the same for both pairs of sides. We found the scale factor is 1.5 for the shorter sides in Jake's rectangles. Now if we look at the longer sides: it's 6 cm in the first rectangle and 9 cm in the second\nStudent Turn 6: How did we know it was 1.5\nTeacher Turn 7: We compared the shorter sides - it was 4 cm in the first rectangle and 6 cm in the second, so we did 6/4 = 1.5\nStudent Turn 7: Ohh ok\nTeacher Turn 8: Then we do the same with the longer sides and see if we get the same result\nStudent Turn 8: So we need you do 4/8\nTeacher Turn 9: That's for Emma's rectangles - we haven't got there yet\nStudent Turn 9: Oh\nTeacher Turn 10: We're still looking at Jake's. In Jake's rectangles, the longer side in the first rectangle is 6 cm and the longer side in the second rectangle is 9 cm\nStudent Turn 10: But 6/6 is 1\nTeacher Turn 11: We need to make sure we're comparing the longer sides in both\nStudent Turn 11: Oh wait I was looking at the wrong length\nTeacher Turn 12: Can you see where the 6 and the 9 cm come from?\nStudent Turn 12: Yes\nTeacher Turn 13: Ok great. So we do 9/6 and that's also equal to 1.5. So the scale factor is 1.5 for both the shorter sides and the longer sides which means that Jake's rectangles are similar\nStudent Turn 13: Ok\nTeacher Turn 14: But we also need to check Emma's. Can you explain to me what we should do first?\nStudent Turn 14: So we should do 4/8\nTeacher Turn 15: Great, comparing the shorter sides. So that simplifies to 0.5. What next?\nStudent Turn 15: We do 6/10\nTeacher Turn 16: Perfect\nStudent Turn 16: Wich is 0.6. So Jake is right\nTeacher Turn 17: Yes, and Emma is wrong - her rectangles aren't similar because the scale factor is different for the two pairs of sides\nStudent Turn 17: Thank you\nTeacher Turn 18: No problem\nStudent Turn 18: Bye Samantha.

So, I would multiply the length by 1.1 to add 10%. then I would multiply the width by 0.9 because that finds me 90%, which is the same as taking away 10%. Now, how do we find area of a rectangle?\nStudent Turn 8: length x width\nTeacher Turn 9: Yes! So multiplying the original lengths will give me the original area. by then multiplying by 1.1 x 0.9 (because that's the change I've made to the two lengths) will show me the new area. 1.1 x 0.9 = 0.99.

Firstly, do you understand where that right angled triangle has come from?\nStudent Turn 3: No idea\nTeacher Turn 4: So Samantha has just cut the original triangle in half by drawing a vertical line down the middle. That's why the length of that top side is now 7cm, because it's half of the 14 cm side. And the diagonal side is still 12 cm\nStudent Turn 4: oh i see. makes sense\nTeacher Turn 5: So then we need to decide which sides are involved in the ratio. In relation to the angle theta, what is the side of 7 cm?\nStudent Turn 5: adjacent? its adjacent to feta\nTeacher Turn 6: Perfect. And how about the side of 12 cm?\nStudent Turn 6: its the hypotunues ( i dont know how to spell it)\nTeacher Turn 7: hypotenuse, great. So the two sides involved in the ratio are A and H. Which ratio uses those two?\nStudent Turn 7: cos?\nTeacher Turn 8: Perfect. so cos theta = A/H\nStudent Turn 8: so cos(theta)=7/12\nTeacher Turn 9: Perfect. And then theta is cosine inverse of 7/12\nStudent Turn 9: so what would I do once i get this formula? I think I subsitute it\nTeacher Turn 10: Now you need to use your calculator.

Are you happy with this now?\nStudent Turn 14: yeah, I sometimes get confused aswell on when to use the -1 thing on my calculator\nTeacher Turn 15: Ok, so when you're finding an angle that's when you need to use the inverse trig functions (the ones with the -1).

If we take 40% away from 100% how much do we have left? \ud83e\udde0\nStudent Turn 3: 60%\nTeacher Turn 4: Amazing so what this question is asking you to do is find 60% of 32 \ud83d\ude03. How do you write 60% as a decimal?\nStudent Turn 4: 0.6\nTeacher Turn 5: Great so in your calculator you need to do 0.6 x 32 = ?\nStudent Turn 5: 19.2. so the answer is C\nTeacher Turn 6: And there's your answer \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d.

I dont really understand the equation?\nTeacher Turn 3: That means our factorised expression would've been 3(2a + \u25cf)\nStudent Turn 3: oh\nTeacher Turn 4: The easiest way to have a go at the question is by ignoring most of the question first, and just thinking about how we can factorise 3a\u00b2 + 2a. To factorise it, we need to look at what both terms have in common - first we can look at the numbers, do 3 and 2 share a common factor? \ud83d\ude0a\nStudent Turn 4: no. 1?\nTeacher Turn 5: Perfect, so now we need to look at a\u00b2 and a, do they share a common factor? \ud83d\ude0a\nStudent Turn 5: a\nTeacher Turn 6: Ah yeah, they do both have 1 but we tend not to take 1 out when we factorise brackets :). Super! So if we take a outside of the bracket, we're dividing 3a\u00b2 + 2a by a, so what will be left inside the bracket? \ud83d\ude0a\nStudent Turn 6: i'm not sure\nTeacher Turn 7: No worries, let's do it separately :). What will happen if we divide 3a\u00b2 by a? :). (Remember we can think of 3a\u00b2 as 3 x a x a if that makes it any easier :)\nStudent Turn 7: if we divided 3a2 by a wouldnt it become 3^2. or 3a\nTeacher Turn 8: Ah I can see why you think that :). It would be 3a - because when we separate it into 3 x a x a, cancelling out one of the a's just leaves us with 3a \ud83d\ude0a\nStudent Turn 8: ohh\nTeacher Turn 9: Awesome, so that means so far we've figured out we'll have a(3a +?). So we just need to look at what 2a will become inside the bracket (when we divide by a), what do you think it'll be? \ud83d\ude0a\nStudent Turn 9: 2\nTeacher Turn 10: Perfect! \u2b50.

We then need to multiply the 9 by 20 as well\nStudent Turn 5: thanks sir or ma'am\nTeacher Turn 6: \ud83d\ude42. 9 x 20 = ?\nStudent Turn 6: i80\nTeacher Turn 7: great, so 9/5 = 180/100\nStudent Turn 7: *180\nTeacher Turn 8: Do you know what 1.9 is as a fraction over 100?\nStudent Turn 8: sorry but if we do 180/100 divided by 20, it will still give us 9/5 that we started with.\nTeacher Turn 9: Yes - we are keeping it as 180/100 though so that we can compare with the 200/100. When the fractions have the same denominator we can compare them. we know that 200% = 200/100 and 9/5 = 180/100 so 9/5 is smaller than 200%\nStudent Turn 9: so i'm assuming that 180/100 is smaller than 200/100\n[END DIALOGUE]\n\nYour final response should have an entry for exactly 9 turns (1-9).", "[BEGIN PROBLEM]\nQuestion Text: Hannah has some apples.

I've just written a lot there, take a moment to read it twice \ud83d\ude00. then let's look at each of the answers. let me know when you're ready for us to look at answer A together\nStudent Turn 2: Ok\nTeacher Turn 3: great! So let's think about Hannah having 66 apples. if she shared them into 6 groups, how many apples would be in each group? ( to work that out we do 66 divided by 6)\nStudent Turn 3: 11\nTeacher Turn 4: I agree! Lovely work \ud83d\ude00. now with 66 apples we can share them into 11 groups but then we have none left over. what that tells us is that 66 isn't the answer to this question. shall we look at B now, or would you like to choose C or D to check next?\nStudent Turn 4: Ok. c\nTeacher Turn 5: let's check C now then. Hannah has 35 apples, how many would be in each group and how many left over? to work that out we want to do 35 divided by 6. and also see if there is a remainder\nStudent Turn 5: 5 and 5 would be left over\nTeacher Turn 6: yes, great work, I got that answer too! so C isn't the answer where there is one left over.

How are you today?\nStudent Turn 1: good\nTeacher Turn 2: Do you need any help with this question?\nStudent Turn 2: Yes, please\nTeacher Turn 3: ok, let's have a think.. from the question, whatever number we choose has to be split into 2 factors, a and b... which means they must be different numbers (as a and b are different). does that rule any answer out?\nStudent Turn 3: Does it rule out C?\nTeacher Turn 4: it does indeed, why?\nStudent Turn 4: Because the next prime factor of 49 is 7 and the other number is also 7 so that means that the letters would be a and a or b and b\nTeacher Turn 5: excellent Max! great explanation \ud83d\ude01\ud83c\udf89. ok, let's look at a, b and d... do any of these numbers make finding 2 different factors difficult?\nStudent Turn 5: D\nTeacher Turn 6: why do think D?\nStudent Turn 6: Because 51 is prime?\nTeacher Turn 7: is it \ud83e\udd14. 51 can be divided by 3...\nStudent Turn 7: If i divide 51 by 3 then i get 17\nTeacher Turn 8: that's right... would that complete the factor tree, or can it be split further?\nStudent Turn 8: That would be the end of the factor tree\nTeacher Turn 9: Excellent!!

Can I please get help with this question? :)\nTeacher Turn 2: No worries\nStudent Turn 2: \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude04\nTeacher Turn 3: When estimating something like this we start by rounding each number to 1 significant figure (the first non zero digit in the number). So we need to decide whether we will round 4.12 to 4 or 5\nStudent Turn 3: okay!\nTeacher Turn 4: Which one do you think we should round 4.12 to?\nStudent Turn 4: we will round 4.12 to 4!!\nTeacher Turn 5: \ud83d\udc4d\nStudent Turn 5: we will round 18.3 to 18!1. 18!!*\nTeacher Turn 6: Not quite, 18 has two significant figure. We want our number to only have one non zero digit. So 18 will either round to 10 or 20\nStudent Turn 6: 19*. 20*\nTeacher Turn 7: Perfect. The reason why we want to do this is so we can make our calculation as easy as possible. multiplying by 18/ 19 is quite difficult it is much easier to multiple by 20. What do you think we would round 0.226 to?\nStudent Turn 7: I'm not really sure.\nTeacher Turn 8: So we are looking for the first non zero digit. Starting from the left and moving right the first number I get to is the 2\nStudent Turn 8: okay.\nTeacher Turn 9: so I will either round 0.226 to 0.2 or 0.3\nStudent Turn 9: 0.2\nTeacher Turn 10: \ud83d\udc4d\nStudent Turn 10: so 4 x 20. divide by 0.2\nTeacher Turn 11: So now the calculation becomes (4 x 20) \u00f7 0.2\nStudent Turn 11: okay!\nTeacher Turn 12: Perfect\nStudent Turn 12: 20x4=80\nTeacher Turn 13: So 4 x 20 =.

(or 15 times 4) :)\nStudent Turn 2: is it 60?\nTeacher Turn 3: it is indeed, well done Griffin! if you think of is this way, we did 4 times 15 instead of 0.4... so we multiplied our 0.4 by 10 to make it 4. so our answer will be ten times too big. so the answer to 04 tuimes 15 must be 10 times smaller than 60. what would that be? :)\nStudent Turn 3: can i have some help on this qustion please its a bit tricky! \ud83d\ude14\nTeacher Turn 4: can you do 60 divided by 10? :)\nStudent Turn 4: 6\nTeacher Turn 5: and that is it :). that is the final answer\nStudent Turn 5: oh that was easy :)\nTeacher Turn 6: Super work!

So, how we start is to think of any multiplication sum that makes 105 (but don't choose 1 x105).\nStudent Turn 4: 3x35\nTeacher Turn 5: Great!  Now check, is either of those numbers prime?\nStudent Turn 5: only 3\nTeacher Turn 6: Yes, great, so we keep the 3 (this will be one of the prime factors). And we break the 35 down further. Can you give me a multiplication sum that makes 35?\nStudent Turn 6: 5x7. theyre both prime\nTeacher Turn 7: Great!  105 = 3x35 = 3x5x7.

So, we do 2 \u2716\ufe0f 4 to calculate 2r\u00b2\nStudent Turn 9: 8\nTeacher Turn 10: Ok, great, so now we've calculated that the first term (2r\u00b2) = 8. Now let's calculate 4r. what sum do you need to do to calculate 4r?\nStudent Turn 10: 4-2\nTeacher Turn 11: Remember that in algebra, when we see a number next to a letter (or letters next to each other) , it means multiply. so you need to do 4 \u2716\ufe0f -2. To do this, first do 4 \u2716\ufe0f 2\nStudent Turn 11: 8\nTeacher Turn 12: Great. And when we multiply a positive number by a negative number, the answer will be negative, so 4 \u2716\ufe0f -2 = -8, is this ok? so, we've got 2r\u00b2 = 8 and 4r = -8. We can now put all this back into the original exxpression:. 2r\u00b2 - 4r = 8- - 8. Do you know what 8--8 = ?

So we need to base our calculation on circumference, not area. So what is the circumference formula?\nStudent Turn 2: pie times diameter?\nTeacher Turn 3: Great! And if we only have part a circle we multiply it by a fraction. What fraction if this is 160 degress?\nStudent Turn 3: 160/360\nTeacher Turn 4: Great!! So that times pi times d = 60. As that is the perimeter given to us. But that includes the two straight bits. Which is 2r\nStudent Turn 4: ohhh okay\nTeacher Turn 5: So 160/360 x pi x d + 2r = 60\nStudent Turn 5: so from there. would you have to minus things of each side to make something else the subject?\nTeacher Turn 6: Great! so let's make it easier by swapping the d for 2r first so it's all radius, nor diameter. *not\nStudent Turn 6: okay\nTeacher Turn 7: Try writing it on paper, as it's easier to see that on here.

Does that make sense?\nStudent Turn 9: yes, why the plus one?\nTeacher Turn 10: because the first bit in the bracket is for the 160/360 x 2r x pi, the second bit is for the 2r that was after the +\nStudent Turn 10: oh okay yep. what comes next\nTeacher Turn 11: So now 2r is there we can do 60 divided by the whole bracket\nStudent Turn 11: ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nTeacher Turn 12: So you'll need the fraction button on your calc, 60 in top. then fraction button in bottom with 160/360 in then x pi + 1 still in bottom. should give you 25.03....

After paying rent how much will he have left?\nStudent Turn 3: 1000\nTeacher Turn 4: \ud83d\udc4d. He then shares this 1000 in the ratio 3:2\nStudent Turn 4: how can we work that out?\nTeacher Turn 5: 1000 is the total amount he is sharing into the ratio 3:2. so we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio\nStudent Turn 5: which is?\nTeacher Turn 6: 3 parts is on living expenses and 2 parts on savings. so how many parts altogether?\nStudent Turn 6: 5\nTeacher Turn 7: \ud83d\udc4d. 5 parts = 1000. 1 part =\nStudent Turn 7: 200\nTeacher Turn 8: \ud83d\udc4d.

It is correct. tell me how you got the 4 and the 7\nStudent Turn 13: It's because it's the first pick so it's all the same! :)\nTeacher Turn 14: yes it is the first pick you're right! and so there are 4 reds out of 7 balls altogether. so the probability of choosng a red is 4/7. so, think about once one red is taken. What is left in the bag? oops it's a cup not a bag hahaha\nStudent Turn 14: I don't know.\nTeacher Turn 15: that's ok thanks for being honest. what is in the cup to start with?\nStudent Turn 15: It's really confusing! Uh 7 balls.\nTeacher Turn 16: yes, and how many of each colour. don't worry, you're doing ok\nStudent Turn 16: 4 red and 3 yellow!! :D\nTeacher Turn 17: \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a just right! now imagine one red ball has been taken out, what is left then? there were 4 red and 3 yellow, what is in the cup after one of the red balls is taken?\nStudent Turn 17: 6 balls left in the bag!! :)\nTeacher Turn 18: true, and how many red and how many yellow are left?\nStudent Turn 18: 4/7\u00d73/6!!\nTeacher Turn 19: oh, tell me where you worked out the 3/6. so far we know that the probability of getting 2 reds is 4/7x3/6\nStudent Turn 19: Because there is still 3 balls left and then 6 left in the bag because we took out the red !  :)\nTeacher Turn 20: yes, I think you are telling me that there are 3 yellows left in the cup and so the prob of a red then a yellow being picked out if 4/7x3/6. which is correct\ud83d\ude00 well done!\nStudent Turn 20: Thank you!! :)\nTeacher Turn 21: oh, before we move on can you tell me what you get when you do the calculation 4/7x3/6?\nStudent Turn 21: 12/42!! When I pressed that answer it said it was wrong.\nTeacher Turn 22: 12/42 is the correct answer for the calcualtion but it isn't the correct final answer for the question. so, what we know so far....... :). is that the prob of red then red is 12/42. AND the prob of a red then a yellow is also 12/42\nStudent Turn 22: We add them!! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\nTeacher Turn 23: YES you are so correct, we do add them...............AND you might remember a few mins ago we had another way of getting at least one red. (there are 3 different ways of getting at least one red so we can work out the 3 probabilities and add them)\nStudent Turn 23: Yellow then red too! :)\nTeacher Turn 24: you got it! so, let's see if we can work out the prob of getting a yellow first and then a red. look at how many yellows there are to start with... and suggest an answer \ud83d\ude0a\nStudent Turn 24: 3/7\u00d74/6!! :)\nTeacher Turn 25: I agree, well done Amira!!\nStudent Turn 25: \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\nTeacher Turn 26: \ud83e\udd47\ud83d\ude00. now, to get the final answer you need to add the three probabilities you worked out\nStudent Turn 26: Now we do 12/42+12/42+12/42!! \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\nTeacher Turn 27: \ud83d\udc4d you've got it!! what is the final answer?\nStudent Turn 27: Which is... 36/42!!!! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\nTeacher Turn 28: \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\ude00. well done! if you have a couple more mins, would you like me to tell you an alternative way which might be faster?\nStudent Turn 28: Thank you so much for helping me!! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a. Oh okay!!\nTeacher Turn 29: so, an alternative way for questions that say AT LEAST ONE........ is to list the possible results, like we did. so we listed RR, RY, YR, YY. does that shorthand make sense?\nStudent Turn 29: Yesss! :D\nTeacher Turn 30: lovely, and then we can look at the options and spot that the only option that ISN'T at least one red is the YY option. so, what you can do then is work out the probability of YY. and then work out one minus that probability. because all the probabilities will add up to 1\nStudent Turn 30: Oo okay! :D\nTeacher Turn 31: so, for example with this one let's work out the prob of YY. I'll let you have a go. Notice ther are 3 yellows to start\nStudent Turn 31: 3/7\u00d72/6!!\nTeacher Turn 32: \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a\nStudent Turn 32: Yayyyy! \ud83d\ude01\nTeacher Turn 33: and what does that equal?\nStudent Turn 33: 6/42!!\nTeacher Turn 34: lovely, and to finish off now work out 1 - 6/42. you can do that by thinking about 42/42 - 6/42. so basically just do 42-6 for the new numerator\nStudent Turn 34: 36/42? :D\nTeacher Turn 35: yes!! WHich is the same as we got a few mins ago by adding the 3 probabilites for RR, RY and YR. thanks Amira, it's been lovely working with you. I'll leave and let you type in your answer, B 3/42 \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4b\nStudent Turn 35: Thank you so much for helping me and explaining really well! :D\n[END DIALOGUE]\n\nYour final response should have an entry for exactly 35 turns (1-35).", "[BEGIN PROBLEM]\nQuestion Text: These two triangles are similar.

Now we have the length of XT is 4a+4b, we factorise it to show it's 4 times a+b. So we write XT = 4(a+b). That shows XT is a multiple of a+b, which means it's parallel to a+b\nStudent Turn 14: So c\nTeacher Turn 15: Yup\nStudent Turn 15: Thank you\nTeacher Turn 16: Sorry I know there's a lot there, do you want to go on or want me to go over anything?\nStudent Turn 16: How to see if it\u2019s a multiple\nTeacher Turn 17: So for example if it was 10a+10b, can you see that's a+b times 10?

Then multiply by the 8. which answer does that match?\nStudent Turn 6: Wait what to mauch info. At once sorry. Hello?\nTeacher Turn 7: So to find a scale factor we divide two boxes next to each other. E.g. 16 divided by 5\nStudent Turn 7: U\nTeacher Turn 8: that tells us how to get from 5 to 16\nStudent Turn 8: Ok\nTeacher Turn 9: we than need to multiply that by 8 to get the missing number\nStudent Turn 9: Alright\nTeacher Turn 10: So can you see 16 divided by 5, multiplied by 8 as one of the options?\nStudent Turn 10: Would that be 2.5\nTeacher Turn 11: We don't need the answer here, notice ABCD are all calculations. So we just want the methods that work and don't work\nStudent Turn 11: Oh sorry\nTeacher Turn 12: Don't apologise, most the time we usually work out answers, so this is an odd one.

We need to find 2 more that work. then the other one is wrong\nStudent Turn 13: Ugh i d\nTeacher Turn 14: Now instead of doing the 16 divide by 5, we could do the 8 divided by 5. Then we'd have to multiply it by 16. Can you see that option in B C or D?\nStudent Turn 14: Yep c\nTeacher Turn 15: Great, so either B or D is our answer. Now 8 divided by 5, doesn't have to use a division symbol. it could use a fraction line instead, as that also shows divide\nStudent Turn 15: Yea that was d\nTeacher Turn 16: Superb! So C/D are actually the same thing, just different symbols. And we know A was right. So that means B is wrong.

(use the 73, 3 to help  you work that out)\nStudent Turn 4: it would be subtracting 70 each time\nTeacher Turn 5: great, yes it would.

So, now you've done that, can you tell me what the values of x could be?\nStudent Turn 4: i  dont know how to do that\nTeacher Turn 5: No worries. To get an answer of 0, when we multiply 2 numbers, at least one of those numbers must be 0. Do you agree?\nStudent Turn 5: i dont understand what you mean\nTeacher Turn 6: So, for example, the anser to all these sums would be 0... 0 \u2716\ufe0f 4. 0 \u2716\ufe0f 5. 7 \u2716\ufe0f 0. -4 \u2716\ufe0f 0. etc.\nStudent Turn 6: yes i understand\nTeacher Turn 7: Ok, so you've given me this factorisation... x(x+4)=0. Which is x multiplied by (x + 4). Ok so far?\nStudent Turn 7: ok\nTeacher Turn 8: And when we multiply them, the answer has to be zero. Because this is what we're solving: x(x+4)=0. So, to get the answer 0, when we multiply x and (x + 4).... Either.... x = 0   OR  x + 4 = 0. Is this ok up to this point?\nStudent Turn 8: yes\nTeacher Turn 9: Fab! So, one of the solutions is x = 0. and the other one, we need to work out from this:. x + 4 = 0. So, this would mean that x = ?\nStudent Turn 9: -4\nTeacher Turn 10: Great!

Exactly! So recapping... 0.15 x 0.2. work out 15 x 2 (so no decimals). That's 30, but 15 to 0.15 is divide by 100, so divide 30 by 100 which is 0.30. Then 2 to 0.2 is divide by 10, so 0.30 divided by 10 is 0.030. Which is the same as 0.03, as we can ignore 0s at the end of decimals.

Let's see. let's split the problem into 2 parts:. 4(2x + 1) first. To expand, we multiply the values outside the brackets with the values inside. 4 x 2x = ?  and 4 x 1 = ? Hi Lina, are you still there? Hello Lina :)\nStudent Turn 3: Hi mia the homework help unclaimed but i think those topics will be fine im stuck on this question\nTeacher Turn 4: No problem, so is it the one 4(3x+2)\nStudent Turn 4: 4(2x=1. 4(2x+1 sorry\nTeacher Turn 5: so 4(2x+1). So when we expand brackets we need to ensure we multiply everything inside by the term on the outside. so let's start. What is 4 x 2x?\nStudent Turn 5: 8x and then 4 x 1 is 4 so 8x + 4\nTeacher Turn 6: Amazing, that is you Lina!!! Fabulous work, well done\nStudent Turn 6: wait no it is not only that. its question 2 cant you see it? expand and simplify: 4(2x+1)-(5x-9)\nTeacher Turn 7: No the questions I see above are different\nStudent Turn 7: oh thats weird but that is the question i see\nTeacher Turn 8: Oh no wait I see it, it was from January. Ok now for these questions we have to think of the two expressions so we already have that 4(2x+1)=8x+4. Now let's do -(5x-9)....what would this become?\nStudent Turn 8: -20x - 36. its the simplify part i am stuck on\nTeacher Turn 9: Not quite....so the 4 is just with the first bracket. The second brackets just has - outside. This means we multiplying everything inside by -1...so -1(5x-9)\nStudent Turn 9: -5x-9?\nTeacher Turn 10: Nearly :) so because it was -9 before when we multiply -9 by -1....we get 9. Because a negative times a negative is a positive\nStudent Turn 10: ahh yess i see. so -5x+9\nTeacher Turn 11: So if we put that together we have 8x+4-5x+9. So we need to collect all our x's then collect all our numbers\nStudent Turn 11: 8x=5x = 3x. 4-+9 is -5. 3x-5?\nTeacher Turn 12: SO we have +4 and +9. That would be +13.... the minus is only with the 5x . Does that make sense ok Lina?\nStudent Turn 12: oh i see because the minus is only the coefficeint of 5x\nTeacher Turn 13: Exactly, amazing!

Then I would check the 3 times table. there is a little trick - if the digits add to a number in the three times table, that number is in the 3 times table too. e.g. 54. 5 + 4 = 9 which is in the 3 times table,so 54 is too. are any of these in the 3 times table?\nStudent Turn 5: oh that's soo cool! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\nTeacher Turn 6: \ud83d\ude00\nStudent Turn 6: no none of them are in the 3 timestable! would you do 10 + 1 to find it out?\nTeacher Turn 7: it would be 1 + 0 + 1\nStudent Turn 7: oh okay! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude04\nTeacher Turn 8: so it looks like we can only rule out C so far\nStudent Turn 8: yes!

Or, 2--10?\nStudent Turn 6: 2 is lower and 10 is higher\nTeacher Turn 7: A difference in maths means subtract....or you can think of it as the distance between the two numbers. So, from -10 up to 0, is 10. And then from 0 up to 2 is 2 more. So from -10 up to 2 is a total of 12. Does this make sense?\nStudent Turn 7: Kind of. Wait yes\nTeacher Turn 8: Ok, great,. So, the distance between -10 and 2 is 12. And this is represented by 6 gaps, so what does each gap represent? Dividing 12 between the 6 gaps...\nStudent Turn 8: 2?\nTeacher Turn 9: Fab! Great work! \ud83d\ude42. So, final stage...what number is B pointing at?\nStudent Turn 9: 8?\nTeacher Turn 10: Not quite....let's count down in 2s from 2:.

And the next bar down (take away 2 again)?\nStudent Turn 11: And then it would be --2  and then -4\nTeacher Turn 12: Yay!  Fab!

So for example if the rule was 2n + 1, for the third term you would do 2 x 3 + 1 = 7, third term is 7.

So we're trying to solve 4(m-1) = 20 and you correctly said we should do an inverse operation. There's more than one place to start with solving this.
