Reason explicitly whether the KCs collectively refer to the same underlying concept or skill, or if they are related but represent distinct or complementary aspects of a broader theme.\n3. Based on your reasoning:\n    - If the KCs refer to the same concept or skill, select one KC from the list that best represents the group \u2014 choose the one that is most clearly worded, generalizable, and inclusive of the others.\n    - If the KCs are related but too distinct to be represented by a single KC, create a brief and meaningful summary name that captures the broader theme shared by the KCs. The summary name must not contain the word \u201cand\u201d.\n\nReturn your output strictly in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"...\",        // Exactly one sentence explaining your reasoning\n  \"representative_kc\": \"...\" , // Selected KC if applicable, otherwise null\n  \"summary_name\": \"...\" ,       // Summary name if representative KC not chosen, otherwise null\n}"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The knowledge components list is:\n[\"Set up and interpret equations based on geometric properties (e.g., equating expressions for equal sides).\", \"Represent and solve real-world problems using linear expressions.\", \"Substitute known values into an equation to represent a real-world situation.\", \"Select the correct equation that models a geometric situation.\", \"Solve equations to find an unknown variable in a geometric context.\", \"Identify the correct equation that models a given scenario.\", \"Set up and interpret a multiplication equation to represent a geometric problem.\", \"Represent real-world relationships using algebraic expressions.\"]"}], "max_completion_tokens": 5000, "temperature": 0.0, "n": 1}}
